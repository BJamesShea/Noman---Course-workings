Object Oriented Programming in Javascript:

    - There is a constructor function that can be used to construct objects. (From our programming In JavaScript)
    - Prototypal Inheritance : legacy ways of doing object oriented programming in Javascript

    Advanced/ES5 ES6 (Real Object Oriented way): Instead of using constructor function, we use something that is called a "class" and then we create object of that class.

    Syntax: 

    class Student {


    }

    class defines a blueprint that contains data and functions inside it. 

    To use this class, we NEED to crearte "object". [Class itself is not usable, unless we create an object of it that contains all the features of the class inside it]

    In Javascript classes, the constructor function is literally called "constructor"

    In ALL other Object oriented Programming languages, constructor fnction has the same name as "class"

    constructor function in class is automatically called when the object of this class is created. Other than constructor, all functions need to be explicitly called.
